A lot of new users have trouble understanding GNU Emacs' undo system, so with the entrence of Sanna Nielsen into /Mellodifestivalen Hall of Fame/ in 2025-02-16 I decided to quickly write a major mode that allows Emacs users to quickly write Nielsen's Eurovision Song Contest entry, even if they don't remember the lyrics at the moment. You can find a recorded performance [[https://youtu.be/55ZJKyLj28w?si=-bw7yUYGUzDTqziA][here]].

Silent, I can't wait here silent
Working up a storm inside my head
Nothing, I just stood for nothing
So I fell for everything you said

Hear the rumble
Hear my voice

Silent, I can't wait here silent
Gotta make a change and make some noise

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad

Trouble, baby I'm in trouble
Everytime I look into your eyes
Save me, oh I'm gonna save me
Far away from all the crazy lies

Hear the rumble
Hear my voice

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad
